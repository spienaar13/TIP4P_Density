# Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Water Density using LAMMPS

This project calculates the density of water using the TP4P Classic Force Field representation at varying temperatures and pressures. The simulations are performed using the LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) package.

## Background

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the physical movements of atoms and molecules. In this project, we use MD simulations to calculate the density of water using the TP4P Classic Force Field. The simulations are carried out using the LAMMPS simulation package at different temperatures and pressures to understand how these variables affect water density.
